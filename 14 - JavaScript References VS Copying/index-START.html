    let age2 = age;

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // team is a reference to the original array players
    const team = players;
    console.log (players, team);

    // if you change team; it changes players
    team [3] = 'Lux';
    console.log (players, team);

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // Make a copy of the array instead of a reference using slice
    const team2 = players.slice ();
    team2 [2] = "Lux";
    console.log (players, team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat (players);
    team3 [2] = "Lux";
    console.log (players, team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4 [2] = "Lux";
    console.log (players, team4);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    const team5 = Array.from (players);
    team5 [2] = "Lux";
    console.log (players, team5);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign ({}, person, {number:99, age:12});
    console.log (cap2, person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
